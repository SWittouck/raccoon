# raccoon

Remark: all functionality implemented in raccoon has been moved to [progenomics](https://github.com/SWittouck/progenomics) and will be maintained there. 

Rapid bActerial Cross-species COmparative geNOmics

* Rapid: all tasks should be feasible to run overnight on a modern desktop computer on thousands of bacterial genomes. 
* Bacterial: archaeal genomes are also fine. "Prokaryotic" didn't fit into the acronym. 
* Cross-species: RACCOON can work with any set of genomes, not necessarily belonging to the same species (in contrast to a tool like e.g. roary). 
* Comparative Genomics: RACCOON contains several pipelines to compare large numbers of genomes. 

RACCOON is currently in development. In the near future, a pipeline will be included that performs extraction of all single-copy core genes from a large set of genomes, and this in a database-independent manner.
